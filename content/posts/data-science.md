I've been a teaching assistant for a Data Science Master's program for the
the past 3 semesters. However, I have absolutely zero plans to try to become
a data scientist.

Here are some of the reasons why:

- Nearly all job positions require you to have an advanced degree even though
  common daily duties (A/B testing, training ML models, etc.) require of what's taught in school to do well.
- Some say that the theory doesn't matter but they want someone who can get the work done without hand holding. That doesn't explain why
  great data analysts and engineers, who don't need hand holding to learn a decent amount of theory, are completely ignored. 
- Many places treat junior data scientists like data janitors. They get to do fairly straightforward like
  data cleaning or feature engineering while more experienced members do the more "important" work of selecting and tuning the models. (However, it's well known that
  problems in the data are one of the most common reasons ML models don't perform well, so technically they're having their junior members do some of the most
  important, but least fun work)
- One would have to take maybe 3-4 upper-division classes (intro to data science, machine learning, recent applications of statistics) to have a decent grasp of data science.
- A data scientist at Facebook told me not to become a data engineer since
  it's a "low-status job." The elitism in this field tends to come out a lot.
- Many roles like "data engineer" and "ML engineer" seem to pop up after companies realize that
  hiring a data scientist with a PhD doesn't mean that magic will get done.
- Not everybody (this is less of a problem now) knows what a data scientist should do. Some design experiments (like A/B tests) frequently,
  others mine data and share insights with executives, others build machine learning models. Each of these roles require very different skillsets.
  
To summarize, the field seems elitist and inexperienced. Since I don't have plans to get an Master's, I expected my chances
of doing interesting work in site reliability, infra, or data engineering are much higher. I'd expect things to get better
over time as companies get a better understanding of what data science is, as better managers
enter the field, and teams learn lessons about what actually matters in data science the hard way.
