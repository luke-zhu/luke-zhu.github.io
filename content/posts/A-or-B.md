title: "Aim for an A or Settle for a B"

Every year while studying for final exams, I find myself
doing the calculations for some class to see whether I should aim for
an A or study just enough for a B instead (thanks to grade inflation). Now that I'm
studying abroad in Edinburgh and forced to take every class pass/fail,
I've ended up thinking about this question earlier.

What I've noticed is that self-studying seems a lot more effective
than just following the curriculum.
It seems fairly easy to look at
a courses material, search the internet, and create
a curriculum that is personally more interesting and
likely more useful to me in the future.

For example if you apply the procedure below, you're
very likely to end up with a more applicable, modern, and
interesting curriculum.

1. Skim through the lecture slides.
2. Google other people's opinion on why to study the subject.
3. Replace the textbook with a more-recommended one. Replace the coursework with something more interesting. Replace final
    exam studying with paper and open-source code readings.
4. Study those things instead when there is lecture.

Here are some example results from doing the above:

#### Advanced Databases
- Read [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/) and [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/))
- Implement a KV store before turning it into a primitive relational databases.
- Dive into the Postgres source code.

With this approach, now I'm learning about LSM trees instead of ISAM and learning about how distributed data systems, which seems
to be a hot engineering and research topic over the past 10 years.

#### Operating Systems
- Read through [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).
  Find papers in places like [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/operating_systems) and read
   them.
- Do the coursework (implementing parts of an OS) since there's seems to be no suitable replacement. Or I could look more into
  projects at other schools to see what seems more interesting.
- Dive into a couple parts of Linux (the scheduler and a device driver look interesting)

Unless I completely screwed up on creating a good curriculum (let me know!), there seems to be
very little risk and a lot of reward by designing your own programme based off
your school's course, the internet's recommendations, and your own interests.

Still, after spending all of this time creating a curriculum, I decided not to just
completely forget about school since (1) I still need to pass the class and (2) I don't
trust myself to consistently study throughout the semester. Instead, I'll focus less on grades, and
replace some of that time by reading papers/open-source code. Nevertheless, there seem to be a lot
of opportunities to create a more personalized and/or modernized experience, and I'd love to see some
work on bringing education more into that area.

### Other Notes
- I only applied the procedure once from the school I'm studying abroad at. If I had
  also checked out say CMU, I would probably do less readings and put more effort into making
  the programming projects more difficult.
- Designing your own curriculum is not only fun, but very educational. In the ~1 hour I spent
  browsing the internet, almost everything I read felt like crucial info that I needed to remember.
- You have to self-learn once you're outside of school so why don't we start encouraging that now?
