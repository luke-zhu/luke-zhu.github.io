        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Seeing the Big Picture with Software Architecture</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            We all love it when that one person in a meeting once again tells everybody to &ldquo;take a step back and think about the big picture.&rdquo; I honestly would be that person for my team projects, but I&rsquo;m currently stuck playing the role of &ldquo;socially-incompetent programmer.&rdquo;
As cliche the advice to &ldquo;think big picture&rdquo; is, there is a lot of merit to it. Software projects generally fail not because the source code is terrible, but because of higher-level issues in the solution design and the management of the project.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Coding More Quickly</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Write test cases. Identify cognitive load, then simplify the problem. Identify the quality level your code should reach. Do things more carefully. Get used to your tools Don&rsquo;t learn new things.  Some ways to code more quickly:
Write a test case to verify that your code works. Why: If you&rsquo;re like me, you celebrate when your code work on the first try. If your code is marginally complicated, It&rsquo;s less costly to make sure your code works before it&rsquo;s in production.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Avoiding data science</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been a teaching assistant for a Data Science Master&rsquo;s program for the the past 3 semesters. However, I have absolutely zero plans to try to become a data scientist.
Here are some of the reasons why:
 Nearly all job positions require you to have an advanced degree even though common daily duties (A/B testing, training ML models, etc.) require of what&rsquo;s taught in school to do well. Some say that the theory doesn&rsquo;t matter but they want someone who can get the work done without hand holding.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Aim for an A or Settle for a B</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Every year while studying for final exams, I find myself doing the calculations for some class to see whether I should aim for an A or study just enough for a B instead (thanks to grade inflation). Now that I&rsquo;m studying abroad in Edinburgh and forced to take every class pass/fail, I&rsquo;ve ended up thinking about this question earlier.
What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that self-studying seems a lot more effective than just following the curriculum.
