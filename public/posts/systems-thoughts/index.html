		<p>I generally keep my perspective of life to myself. However, it comes up a bit too often and I&rsquo;ve noticed that I have a hard time explaining it to others, because of the jargon I&rsquo;ve accrued and my lack of simple examples.</p>

<p>Below is just a semi-structured list of things which describe my worldview, hopefully in a form that makes sense to other people.</p>

<ol>
<li>I view myself and my life as a black box system. I really don&rsquo;t understand much about myself. I don&rsquo;t understand why I get sick. I don&rsquo;t understand why I learn some things quickly while I am a perpetual novice in other things. I don&rsquo;t know the problems I&rsquo;ll face in 5 years.

<ul>
<li>You could say that I practice life systems engineering.</li>
<li>As I learned through my systems classes: To design a good complex system, you want to know what your goals and values are. You need to know when to simplify and make tradeoffs. You need to prepare to evolve and adapt your system over time.</li>
<li>As popularized by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>, I sometimes see myself as two different beings. Other times, I&rsquo;m actually 10 different Lukes. It depends on how crazy I want to appear. In reality, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what &ldquo;self&rdquo; means.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe the world has changed drastically over the last few centuries, and the fundamentals of living life well have changed as well. I abuse the internet a lot.

<ul>
<li>My parents lived in an age where it seemed like the only path out of working in a factory was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_College_Entrance_Examination">Chinese College Entrance Exam</a>. Their high school lives were far different than mine; studying until 11pm every day was just what everybody did. As a result, many of their values made no sense to me, a high schooler living comfortably in a world full of distractions. At the same time, many values that make no sense to you were engrained in me at a young age.</li>
<li>Learning on your own is far faster in the internet age. Also, the fundamentals of learning on your own are different than the fundamentals of learning in school. The hardest parts of learning on your own are figuring out your syllabus and finding time to learn.</li>
<li>You can even learn how to be a great conversationalist, an &ldquo;extrovert&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;good human being&rdquo; (whatever that means). In the past, you could easily die regretting making &ldquo;basic mistakes&rdquo;, like neglecting your wife from an arranged marriage for 30 years or working so hard that chronic pain prevents you from enjoying your later years. Nowadays, many of these basic mistakes are documented on the internet or in books.</li>
<li>In the modern world, you have millions of people working hard at multinational companies to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; your attention and time. There are even good arguments that <a href="https://alexand.ro/2018/08/how-focus-became-more-valuable-than-intelligence">focus is more important than intelligence</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the same time, I believe that scholars of the past have amazing insights. Key fundamentals of living life well have been forgotten, since our parents and grandparents neglected them in favor of science (which works pretty well). In addition, as the world changes, techniques of the past <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yanlei/courses/CS691LL-f06/papers/SH05.pdf">come around again</a>.

<ul>
<li>But I haven&rsquo;t studied them much at all.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe <em>keeping up a good mood while emphasizing on growth</em> is a <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf">silver bullet</a> for achieving career success. This is mainly because being in a good mood increases willpower, which is more important in the modern age. To maintain a good mood, there are 3 main categories of things to do:

<ul>
<li><strong>Physical:</strong> sleep, exercise, diet, hydration, posture</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> talking to anyone (though certain types of interactions are better)</li>
<li><strong>Mental</strong> framing things properly, not ruminating, mindfulness, accepting reality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe that progress is the fundamental unit to focus on. It meshes well with high mood. I see prioritization and planning as multipliers of future progress.</li>
<li>I see my body as a complex distributed system and my conscious self as the operator. So, I&rsquo;m looking out often for emergent behavior (esp. ones that result in cascading failures), monitoring key metrics (like how much I&rsquo;m sleeping and how tired I feel), and trying to improve the resilience of myself.

<ul>
<li>Chaos engineering is something that I think I&rsquo;ll do more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Humility and confidence are hard to balance. You need to have faith in yourself to get things done. (Over)confidence is associated with positive results, especially in social interactions. At the same time, it&rsquo;s true that we understand so little about the world. I don&rsquo;t know much about myself, software engineering, computer science, etc.

<ul>
<li>These forces come into play when developing software. You need the humility to accept that you don&rsquo;t know much about the user, that there is a better architectural design out there, and that you will likely implement the software more slowly than you expect. At the same time, you need the confidence and decisiveness to just start making progress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I want to make the world a better place. I want to enjoy life a lot.

<ul>
<li>There is a feedback loop between these two goals:

<ul>
<li>If I only care about enjoying life a lot, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to focus completely on enjoying life. Life easily starts to feel meaningless and frustrating. Work, traffic, and your friends&rsquo; busy schedules are all getting in your way of enjoying life. So, focusing on something altruistic and meaningful may in fact make it easier to enjoy life a lot.</li>
<li>If I only care about making the world better, I still need to accept that I am human. If I let myself burnout or get depression, I&rsquo;m losing time that I could be spending making the world better. So, it makes sense to keep up a better mood to avoid such problems. In fact, it seems like staying in a really good mood might be worth it because of the added willpower it gives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This means that it&rsquo;s not good enough for me to just make lots of money. I want to have the skills and knowledge to tackle problems that matter.</li>
<li>I consistently donate small amounts, because I don&rsquo;t really trust myself that much.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I see myself becoming a founding engineer in next 15 years, but I&rsquo;m flexible. I think my current skillset aligns well with that. I think that success as a founding engineer would
allow me to transition into big impact opportunities around world problems <em>that I&rsquo;d have the skillset to succeed in.</em></li>
<li>I see myself emphasizing growth, confluence, and balance over the years.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, there is a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in how I view the world. There is a computer systems bias to how I do things. I didn&rsquo;t say much about how I view relationships, which might make me seem cold and robotic. There is an ambiguous balance of clarity and flexibility in my plans. Nevertheless, this is not my #1 priority in life, so I&rsquo;ll end things here.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing how this pans out and how I change over the next few years!</p>
