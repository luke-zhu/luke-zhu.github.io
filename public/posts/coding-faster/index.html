<ul>
<li>Write test cases.</li>
<li>Identify cognitive load, then simplify the problem.</li>
<li>Identify the quality level your code should reach.</li>
<li>Do things more carefully.</li>
<li>Get used to your tools</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t learn new things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some ways to code more quickly:</p>

<h3 id="write-a-test-case-to-verify-that-your-code-works">Write a test case to verify that your code works.</h3>

<p><em>Why:</em> If you&rsquo;re like me, you celebrate when your code work on the first try. If your code is marginally complicated, It&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.celerity.com/the-true-cost-of-a-software-bug">less costly</a>
     to make sure your code works before it&rsquo;s in production.</p>

<h3 id="reduce-your-problem-into-smaller-chunks">Reduce your problem into smaller chunks.</h3>

<p><em>Why:</em> Your brain is very small. Trying to keep everything in your brain is like trying to store critical data only in the cache.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/ComputerMemoryHierarchy.svg/1920px-ComputerMemoryHierarchy.svg.png" style="max-width:80%;max-height:400px"></p>

<p>A rule of thumb I use is that I stop to chunk down tasks if I&rsquo;m starting to feel the affects of cognitive overload.</p>

<p>If you are feeling some of the below symptoms, you should try taking a break.</p>

<ul>
<li>You decide to write a TODO or update some documentation and then you can&rsquo;t remember what you need to do.</li>
<li>You notice yourself just staring into space thinking very hard about &hellip; something?</li>
<li>You are making a lot of typos.</li>
<li>You are randomly scrolling through the file.</li>
<li>You have a strong urge to not write tests or documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I don&rsquo;t have scientific evidence that reducing cognitive load increases productivity, but here
are some strategies you can use</p>

<ul>
<li>Iteration - Write prototype (pseudo)code and then cycling through a few times to turn that into production-grade code.</li>
<li>Layering/checkpointing - Split the task into different steps. Complete each task and verify that your code is correct at that stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to think of things is to turn your task into a tree (or graph) of easier sub-tasks.</p>

<h3 id="know-how-reliability-your-code-needs-to-be">Know how reliability your code needs to be</h3>

<p><em>Why:</em> We have a tendency to either aim for perfection or to just get shit done quickly.</p>

<p>After you have that number, it becomes a lot easier to decide in the moment whether you should
rewrite or just quarantine that terrible piece of code.</p>

<h3 id="get-used-to-your-tools-and-don-t-switch-all-of-the-time">Get used to your tools (and don&rsquo;t switch all of the time)</h3>

<p><em>Why</em>: It takes time to get familiar with a new IDE, cloud provider, and/or programming language.
If your goal is to write code quickly, then you will not want small kinks about your text editor
or operating system distracting you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t play around with the base tools that you use <em>unless you are willing
to take the short-term loss.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Operating system</li>
<li>Web Browser</li>
<li>Programming Language</li>
<li>IDE/Editor

<ul>
<li>Keymap</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cloud Service Provider</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, it pays off the reflect and think about what tools you use
often use. You might notice that you are using</p>

<h3 id="do-things-more-slowly">Do Things More Slowly</h3>

<p><em>Why</em>: If you are making typos, losing track of the task, or not taking care
   of unhandled conditional states <em>and you know that you shouldn&rsquo;t be making those slips</em>, then
   you can just slow down and avoid them. As I said before, the brain is small.</p>

<h3 id="don-t-learn-new-things">Don&rsquo;t Learn New Things</h3>

<p><em>Why</em>: Seriously. If you just care about coding quickly, then use the things you are familiar with.
    Even if you only used a tool over a weekend, you&rsquo;ll probably end up saving 5-10+ work hours just
    from having that experience.</p>

<h2 id="also-everything-has-a-tradeoff">Also: Everything has a tradeoff</h2>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;ve just been rambling for a while, but as you get more experience, you will
understand that nothing is perfect. The above tips are only rule of thumbs with numerous of edge cases.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>You may not be able to easily write a test case that uses the same environment variables and databases as the production environment.</li>
<li>If you can rerun the program quickly (like in a Jupyter Notebook), then you may be able to get away without automated testing.</li>
<li>Using new tools may be better in the long-term.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The goal isn&rsquo;t to become a faster programmer immediately. One should slowly gain experience, build habits, and
learn theory to improve.

<ul>
<li>The reason a lot of more experienced programmers don&rsquo;t code quickly is because they have bad habits. For example, they
may have too much knowledge and not know how to stop at the right code reliability level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It may not pay off to focus solely on coding more quickly.
The general consensus in industry is that
new programmers don&rsquo;t write code that is reliable and maintainable enough.</li>
<li>Bugs generally occur at the non-code level. For example, the overall design of the solution may be
too slow for the customer or the solution uses packages that can&rsquo;t be used in production. Bugs also tend
to consolidate around places where work is split between people (integration points).

<ul>
<li>If you want to code
quickly while writing good code, you should aim to be careful at those points. Write your integration and
end-to-end tests. Invest some time to understand what the PM and users want. If you notice an issue with the design
while coding, bring the issue up to others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It rarely pays off to argue with others about your code. Often you should just do what the team
wants. This doesn&rsquo;t mean being a pushover, you should defend yourself when needed.</li>
<li>Other things: stay focused, don&rsquo;t get distracted while your code compiles or your tests run.</li>
</ul>
