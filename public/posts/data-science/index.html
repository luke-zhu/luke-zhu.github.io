		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a teaching assistant for a Data Science Master&rsquo;s program for the
the past 3 semesters. However, I have absolutely zero plans to try to become
a data scientist.</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nearly all job positions require you to have an advanced degree even though
common daily duties (A/B testing, training ML models, etc.) require of what&rsquo;s taught in school to do well.</li>
<li>Some say that the theory doesn&rsquo;t matter but they want someone who can get the work done without hand holding. That doesn&rsquo;t explain why
great data analysts and engineers, who don&rsquo;t need hand holding to learn a decent amount of theory, are completely ignored.</li>
<li>Many places treat junior data scientists like data janitors. They get to do fairly straightforward like
data cleaning or feature engineering while more experienced members do the more &ldquo;important&rdquo; work of selecting and tuning the models. (However, it&rsquo;s well known that
problems in the data are one of the most common reasons ML models don&rsquo;t perform well, so technically they&rsquo;re having their junior members do some of the most
important, but least fun work)</li>
<li>One would have to take maybe 3-4 upper-division classes (intro to data science, machine learning, recent applications of statistics) to have a decent grasp of data science.</li>
<li>A data scientist at Facebook told me not to become a data engineer since
it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;low-status job.&rdquo; The elitism in this field tends to come out a lot.</li>
<li>Many roles like &ldquo;data engineer&rdquo; and &ldquo;ML engineer&rdquo; seem to pop up after companies realize that
hiring a data scientist with a PhD doesn&rsquo;t mean that magic will get done.</li>
<li>Not everybody (this is less of a problem now) knows what a data scientist should do. Some design experiments (like A/B tests) frequently,
others mine data and share insights with executives, others build machine learning models. Each of these roles require very different skillsets.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, the field seems elitist and inexperienced. Since I don&rsquo;t have plans to get an Master&rsquo;s, I expected my chances
of doing interesting work in site reliability, infra, or data engineering are much higher. I&rsquo;d expect things to get better
over time as companies get a better understanding of what data science is, as better managers
enter the field, and teams learn lessons about what actually matters in data science the hard way.</p>
