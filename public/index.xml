      <description>Write test cases. Identify cognitive load, then simplify the problem. Identify the quality level your code should reach. Do things more carefully. Get used to your tools Don&amp;rsquo;t learn new things.  Some ways to code more quickly:
Write a test case to verify that your code works. Why: If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you celebrate when your code work on the first try. If your code is marginally complicated, It&amp;rsquo;s less costly to make sure your code works before it&amp;rsquo;s in production.</description>

      <title>Avoiding data science</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a teaching assistant for a Data Science Master&amp;rsquo;s program for the the past 3 semesters. However, I have absolutely zero plans to try to become a data scientist.
Here are some of the reasons why:
 Nearly all job positions require you to have an advanced degree even though common daily duties (A/B testing, training ML models, etc.) require of what&amp;rsquo;s taught in school to do well. Some say that the theory doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter but they want someone who can get the work done without hand holding.</description>

      <title>Aim for an A or Settle for a B</title>

      <description>Every year while studying for final exams, I find myself doing the calculations for some class to see whether I should aim for an A or study just enough for a B instead (thanks to grade inflation). Now that I&amp;rsquo;m studying abroad in Edinburgh and forced to take every class pass/fail, I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up thinking about this question earlier.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that self-studying seems a lot more effective than just following the curriculum.</description>
