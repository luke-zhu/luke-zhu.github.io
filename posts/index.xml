      <description>Every year while studying for final exams, I find myself doing the calculations to see whether I should aim for an A or study just enough for a B instead. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m studying abroad in Edinburgh and forced to take every class pass/fail, I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up thinking about this question earlier.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that self-studying seems a lot more effective than just following the curriculum. It seems fairly easy to look at a courses material, search the internet, and create a curriculum that is personally more interesting and likely more useful to me in the future.</description>
